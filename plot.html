            <p class="pp1">It was 12am, in the month of june and a guy known by the name "Aarush" was really craving some icecream , he goes up to the fridge , but there was no icecream he became sad D: but there was no help in the middle of the night,then he set out on a great mission of creating this website, and this it came into being.</p>
            <p class="pp2">It happens to be that this guy Aarush is quite smart because he not only created a website for #swirl , but also made a platform to advertise his 2D game , truly exhilarating , now he lies in wait as his plan comes into actoin, its just a matter of time before he completes his mission</p>
